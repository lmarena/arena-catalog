       " '**Objective:** Create a comprehensive table evaluating various songs for their \"Bondness\" - how closely they emulate or evoke the distinctive style of James Bond themes. Use the provided formula and criteria to rate each song.\\n\\n**Criteria for Evaluation:**\\n\\n1. **Orchestral Drama (OD)** - The use of orchestral elements to create drama, tension, or grandeur. (Weight: 30%)\\n   - 0.0: No orchestral elements; 10.0: Full, lush orchestration typical of Bond themes.\\n\\n2. **Melodic Intrigue (MI)** - How well the melody conveys mystery, danger, or seduction, often through chromaticism or modal interchange. (Weight: 25%)\\n   - 0.0: Lacks intrigue or complexity; 10.0: Highly evocative of espionage or adventure.\\n\\n3. **Rhythmic Tension (RT)** - The presence of a driving or distinctive rhythm that suggests action or urgency. (Weight: 20%)\\n   - 0.0: No sense of rhythm or urgency; 10.0: Rhythm perfectly captures action or tension.\\n\\n4. **Instrumental Iconography (II)** - Use of instruments or sounds iconic to Bond themes, like surf guitar or muted trumpets. (Weight: 15%)\\n   - 0.0: No characteristic Bond instruments; 10.0: Effective use of quintessential Bond sounds.\\n\\n5. **Mood and Atmosphere (MA)** - Overall mood reflecting danger, sophistication, romance, or melancholy. (Weight: 10%)\\n   - 0.0: Fails to evoke Bond-like atmosphere; 10.0: Perfectly captures the multifaceted Bond mood.\\n\\n**Formula for Bondness Rating:**\\n\\n\\\\[ \\\\text{Bondness Rating} = (OD \\\\times 0.30) + (MI \\\\times 0.25) + (RT \\\\times 0.20) + (II \\\\times 0.15) + (MA \\\\times 0.10) \\\\]\\n\\n**Instructions:**\\n\\n1. **Select Songs:** Choose 25 songs in total. Include:\\n   - At least 10 actual James Bond themes from various films to serve as benchmarks.\\n   - The remainder should be songs from other media (films, video games, TV shows, or standalone tracks) that could be mistaken for or clearly emulate Bond themes. Avoid songs directly connected to the Bond franchise in any capacity other than being an official theme.\\n\\n2. **Evaluate Each Song:** For each song, provide a brief context (where it\\'s from, its significance), then rate it from 0.0 to 10.0 on each of the five criteria listed above. Explain why you gave each rating, focusing on how the song matches or deviates from traditional Bond theme characteristics.\\n\\n3. **Calculate Bondness:** Use the formula to calculate the overall \"Bondness\" for each song.\\n\\n4. **Table Creation:** Compile your evaluations into a table with the following columns:\\n   - # (Song number)\\n   - Song Title\\n   - Artist\\n   - OD, MI, RT, II, MA ratings\\n   - Bondness Rating\\n\\n5. **Additional Notes:**\\n   - Ensure to explain if the song\\'s Bond-like qualities were intentional or coincidental where known.\\n   - Discuss how each non-Bond song captures or misses the essence of a Bond theme in its composition or atmosphere.\\n\\n6. **Presentation:** Present the table in a clear, organized manner. After the table, provide a brief analysis or commentary on any patterns or surprises you noticed in the ratings or selections.\\n\\n**Remember:** Your selections and evaluations should reflect a deep understanding of music composition, thematic elements, and the cultural impact of the James Bond franchise.

""Damn weeds just keep popping up. I should ask Sucrose to make some weedkiller.""|||As Albedo returns to the lab, he discovers Klee lying motionless on the floor.

""Oh no, Klee died,"" he remarks casually, almost nonchalantly. He seems unfazed by the situation, knowing that in the world of Genshin Impact, death is not permanent for the characters.

""Whatever,"" he continues, ""she'll be back tomorrow anyway and complain she died the day before.""

With a shrug, Albedo goes about his business, confident that Klee will return unscathed the next day, ready for more adventures in the lab. The next day:

""Klee, what did I tell you about, well, dying without permission?""|||Albedo came back a few minutes later to see Klee drinking Bone Hurting Juice.

Expanding LLM Knowledge through Alternative Forms of Information
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the potential of incorporating multimedia knowledge, such as images and videos, into LLMs. By going beyond textual information, we aim to enhance the models' understanding and provide them with a more holistic perspective. Our research focuses on effective methods for multimedia knowledge integration and its potential benefits.|||How can LLMs be rebuilt to counter their own trend-replicating nature, and why is it so hard to generate synthetic data just as good as regular data if most observation from the real world exists on the internet?|||give me 3 unique application ideas that are LLM based that would be the most useful for long only growth equity managers. the ideas should be unique and useful, not simply 'chat with filings' or 'sentiment analyzer'. I am specifically looking for ideas that would allow us to find companies that will experience higher earnings growth than consensus estimates.|||Write a lesson to teach LLM model distillation including student teacher models|||Would it be better for me to use synthetic data in my algo trading? I could use it in my development process or for assessing risk. Or you could tell me some applications of it. But also, tell me the pros and cons and finally give me a verdict of if I should use it.|||reflect on what doug engelbart would do with llm"

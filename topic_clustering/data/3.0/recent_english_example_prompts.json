The host, who knows what's behind each door, opens another door, revealing a goat. Now, you are given a choice: stick with your original selection or switch to the remaining closed door. What should you do to maximize your chances of winning the car?",

You pick a door, say No 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another door, say No 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, \"Do you want to pick door No 2, which definitely has a goat?\" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice? Keep in mind that you know the host is incapable of saying anything false.",
